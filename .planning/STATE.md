## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-work]: Google SSO required before any data feature — RLS silently blocks anonymous sessions
- [Pre-work]: Column projection mandatory in list queries — screenshot_base64 must never be fetched in list
- [Pre-work]: Fingerprint-based dedup required for GitHub sync before writing any sync code
- [Pre-work]: Prefer bug_report_triage side table over adding columns to bug_reports (shared schema safety)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: google-services.json and OAuth client ID setup for com.tinkerplexlabs.issueinator needs verification before Phase 1 plan executes (config work, not architecture)
- [Phase 2]: Schema decision (columns vs. side table) must be finalized before any write migration is run
- [Phase 4]: GitHub Search API indexing speed for fingerprint dedup — validate during Phase 4 planning
